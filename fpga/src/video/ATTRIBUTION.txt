Traced back to Atari ST core 
from https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano e0b218b79fe2991b9d8ff11e197e8e2b79b20241 or earlier

No explicity license but GPL-v3 licensed code present in the same project.

Then: Changes to the mode table for C64 
from https://github.com/vossstef/tang_nano_20k_c64 b2c30eeca47cc268eba64be501f55fcc83eb075b

My understanding is that this is now GPL-v3 as explicitly stated in the last source.
