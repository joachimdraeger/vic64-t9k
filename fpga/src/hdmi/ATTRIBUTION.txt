SystemVerilog code for HDMI 1.4b video/audio output on an FPGA.
https://github.com/hdl-util/hdmi
Originally dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0.

Then: Adaptation for an Atari ST core 
from https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano

No explicity license but GPL-v3 licensed code present in the same project.

Current: Changes to the mode table for C64 
from https://github.com/vossstef/tang_nano_20k_c64

My understanding is that this is now GPL-v3 as explicitly stated in the last source.
